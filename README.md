# Utils
Some helpful python utility libraries for working with CMB data, healpix maps, power spectra etc.
    - jkcl: Takes jackknife resampling of cmb healpix map(s) and computes a set of (cross)correlated power spectra.
    - bincl: Performs evenly spaced binning of power spectra on a logarithmic scale.

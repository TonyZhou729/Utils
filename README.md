# Utils
Some helpful python utility libraries for working with CMB data, healpix maps, plotting power spectra etc.

- jkcl: Takes jackknife resampling of cmb healpix map(s) and computes a set of (cross)correlated power spectra.
- bincl: Returns evenly spaced binning of power spectra on a logarithmic scale.
